    "# Introduction\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique window to study the profound influence of human behavior on urban energy consumption, transportation, and other facets of urban life. Forced by the global health crisis and the consequential policies, such as lockdowns, society has embraced unprecedented lifestyle shifts, most notably remote work. During this period, we witnessed a mass exodus from densely populated metropolitan areas, and intriguingly, some individuals opted to remain in less dense areas even post-pandemic. This global event has inadvertently orchestrated a large-scale experiment, dividing our lives into pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases. Despite the tragedy of the disease, it is crucial that we seize this opportunity to understand how diverse societal groups have adapted to the pandemic and how their behavioral changes have reshaped urban spaces and environments. In an attempt to quantify these shifts, I aim to utilize mobility and energy consumption data.\n",

    "1. What is the worldwide trend of working from home (WFH) during and post the COVID-19 pandemic, and what factors might account for the observed variations?\n",
    "2. How has building energy consumption responded to the pandemic, and what variables might explain the differences in changes across various regions or types of buildings?\n",

    "- [?] WFH data doesn't have much 3D factors, it might not look great and might not be the best way to showcase Urban."

    "- Explanatory Variables:\n",
    "    - Population: The total county population was utilized as a measurement of county size.\n",
    "    - High education level: The percentage of the population with a Bachelor's degree or higher.\n",
    "    - High household Income: The percentage of households with incomes exceeding $200,000.\n",
    "    - Occupation: the percentage of the population employed in three industries with a higher likelihood of WFH and three industries with a lower likelihood of WFH based on experience. \n",

    "For each region-category, the baseline isn’t a single value—it’s 7 individual values. The same number of visitors on 2 different days of the week, result in different percentage changes. So, we recommend the following:\n",
